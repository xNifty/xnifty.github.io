# Welcome to my GitHub Pages, documenting all my projects for [Snoring Ninja](https://snoring.ninja)

These pages will document everything I possibly can or feel the need to, in regards to: 

* [niftybot-discord](https://github.com/xnifty/niftybot-discord)  


## Internal Links
---
* [niftybot-discord documentation](/niftybot-discord)

**Note:**  
Documentation will be constantly ongoing for a decent deal of time, due to me being busy working on the niftybot-discord project (refactoring, constantly), which means documentation could technically go out of date rather quickly; with that being said, documentation will be done at some point.
